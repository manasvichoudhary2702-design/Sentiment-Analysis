## 📊 Sentiment Analysis

* Reviews were classified into three categories:

  * **Positive** → Customers satisfied with food quality, delivery time, or service.
  * **Negative** → Customers unhappy with late delivery, poor packaging, or bad taste.
  * **Neutral** → Reviews that are factual or balanced without clear sentiment.

* The distribution of sentiments was analyzed and visualized using charts and word clouds.

* **Word Clouds** were used to highlight recurring terms in positive and negative reviews separately.
